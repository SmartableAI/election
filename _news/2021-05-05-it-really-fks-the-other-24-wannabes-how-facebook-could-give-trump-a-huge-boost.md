title: "‘It really f**ks the other ‘24 wannabes' — How Facebook could give Trump a huge boost"
excerpt: "Donald Trump’s potential reemergence on Facebook this week could dramatically upend politics. But it’s not the megaphone the platform offers him — it’s the money. Trump has not been on Facebook since it booted him in the wake of his encouragement of the January 6 riots at the Capitol."
