title: "Fact Check: Did Chinese Media Depict Joe Biden as 'Loser' Soldier Captured by Taliban?"
excerpt: "A cartoon of President Joe Biden surrendering to Taliban militants appeared on popular social media sites in the final days of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan. An illustration showing a giant figure of Biden—in military fatigues and kneeling on the ground while surrounded by smaller Taliban fighters—was said to have been produced by China 's state-owned media to mock America."
