  - title: "Bet On It. Trump Is Running."
    excerpt: "President Donald Trump wants to run for president in 2024, and so he shall. The story some Republicans like to tell themselves -- that Trump will not run again for the White House because he knows he can't win and he's smart enough to see the glory in being a GOP kingmaker -- is wishful thinking."
