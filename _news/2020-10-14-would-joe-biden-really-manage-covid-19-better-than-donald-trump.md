title: "Would Joe Biden really manage COVID-19 better than Donald Trump?"
excerpt: "Joe Biden wants the election to be, in significant part, a referendum on how Donald Trump has managed the COVID-19 outbreak. Fair enough. COVID-19 was the big event in Trumpâ€™s first term, and there is a lot of valid criticism to be made about how he has responded."
