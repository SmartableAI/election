title: "Betting on the 'base' — can Trump win again?"
excerpt: "President Trump has said he intends to win the 2020 election the same way he won the 2016 election. Not with a popular vote strategy. With an electoral vote strategy. He expects his vaunted “base” — concentrated in a few crucial states — to deliver an electoral vote majority for him just as it did four years ago."

  - title: "The crazy uncle: Trump puts right-wing extremism on the ballot"
    excerpt: "What if the result of the 2016 election was primarily the product of a flawed electoral-college system, the mistaken assumption of too many voters and pundits that Donald Trump couldn’t win, and a last-minute intervention by an FBI director?"
