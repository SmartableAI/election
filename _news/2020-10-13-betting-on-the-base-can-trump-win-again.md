title: "Betting on the 'base' — can Trump win again?"
excerpt: "President Trump has said he intends to win the 2020 election the same way he won the 2016 election. Not with a popular vote strategy. With an electoral vote strategy. He expects his vaunted “base” — concentrated in a few crucial states — to deliver an electoral vote majority for him just as it did four years ago."
