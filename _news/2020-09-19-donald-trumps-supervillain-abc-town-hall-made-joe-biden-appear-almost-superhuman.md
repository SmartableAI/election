title: "Donald Trump's supervillain ABC town hall made Joe Biden appear almost superhuman"
excerpt: "Like most Americans, I didn’t watch President Trump’s town hall on Tuesday night. I was too busy doing anything else. Two days later, I capitulated and watched it on demand. Five minutes later, Joe Biden’s town hall began."

  - title: "Donald Trump's supervillain ABC town hall made Joe Biden appear almost superhuman"
    excerpt: "Five minutes later, Joe Biden’s town hall began. The contrast was startling. Unlike Trump — who sat during his town hall — Biden stood during his, as if the national anthem were playing. Trump looked lumpish and sounded confused."

    excerpt: "A Joe Biden town hall does not hit the Pinocchio meter as much as a Donald Trump town hall.
