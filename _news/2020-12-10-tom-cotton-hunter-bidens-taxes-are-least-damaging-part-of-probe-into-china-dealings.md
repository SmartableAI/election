    excerpt: "This is a rush transcript from “The Story with Martha MacCallum\" November 30, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Bret. Good to see you tonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York, and this is THE STORY. So, as President Trump prepares to head to Georgia on Saturday to rally the vote for the two Republicans who can make or break the GOP Senate majority, he will have to thread the needle of his dissatisfaction with Governor Kemp and the candidates who can cement his legacy.

Geraldo Rivera, Fox News Correspondent-at-Large. GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: Hi, everybody. Great to have you with us tonight. The first thing that I just want to note with regard to these election issues,"
