MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Bret. Good to see you tonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York, and this is THE STORY. So, as President Trump prepares to head to Georgia on Saturday to rally the vote for the two Republicans who can make or break the GOP Senate majority, he will have to thread the needle of his dissatisfaction with Governor Kemp and the candidates who can cement his legacy. As Victor Davis Hanson writes of the president today, he has a year or more to decide whether he wishes to play kingmaker among would-be Republican congressional and presidential candidates or run himself for a second term. Geraldo Rivera, Fox News Correspondent-at-Large. GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: Hi, Martha. MACCALLUM: Hi, everybody. Great to have you with us tonight.
