title: "Joe Biden’s ‘Groundhog Day’ moment"
excerpt: "But Joe Biden is actually living that reality. It’s not simply that Biden was elected president after serving as vice president. It’s that the situation he will face when he enters the White House next month is eerily parallel to the one he faced with Barack Obama when they were elected in 2008."
