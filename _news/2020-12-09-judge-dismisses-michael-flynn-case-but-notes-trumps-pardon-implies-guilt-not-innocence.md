title: "Judge dismisses Michael Flynn case but notes Trump's pardon implies guilt, not innocence"
excerpt: "U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan dismissed the case following a full and unconditional pardon that President Donald Trump issued for Flynn. But in a 43-page memorandum, Sullivan also said: \"A pardon does not necessarily render 'innocent' a defendant of any alleged violation of the law."
