title: "Trump Administration Slashing Refugee Admissions To Lowest Level Yet"
excerpt: "The Trump administration announced late Wednesday it will admit only up to 15,000 refugees into the U.S. in fiscal year 2021—marking the lowest cap on admissions the administration has set yet—continuing the government’s steady decrease in refugee admissions over the course of Donald Trump’s presidency as he frequently condemns migrants on the campaign trail."
