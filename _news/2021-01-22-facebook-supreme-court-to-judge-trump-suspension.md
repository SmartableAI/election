title: "Facebook 'Supreme Court' To Judge Trump Suspension"
excerpt: "Facebook and Instagram suspended Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, an attack on the seat of democracy that led to Trump's second impeachment. The leading social network is referring the decision to its independent oversight board -- known informally as the Facebook \"supreme court\" -- with the authority to make binding rulings even chief executive Mark Zuckerberg must abide by."
