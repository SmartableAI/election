title: "California governor gently confronts Trump on climate"
excerpt: "California Gov. Gavin Newsom had President Donald Trump one-on-one on live TV Monday, a perfect opportunity to spar with Democrats' public enemy No. 1 just 50 days before the election. But Newsom dropped the fiery tone he has employed in recent weeks about climate change and its role in five of the largest fires California has ever seen."
