  - title: "Trump predicted news ratings would ‘tank if I’m not there.’ He wasn’t wrong."
    excerpt: "Newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I’m not there,” he augured in 2017, “because without me, their ratings are going down the tubes.” Barely two months into the post-Trump era, news outlets are indeed losing much of the audience and readership they gained during his chaotic presidency."
