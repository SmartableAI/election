title: "Pro-Trump and anti-vax sites urging people to forge COVID-19 vaccination cards, says CDC"
excerpt: "Faking a vaccination is easy with a template and blank flashcard. New York is the only state that keeps track of authentic cards. It is against the law to fake vaccination cards. Some former President Trump supporters and anti-vaxxers are forging vaccine cards using a government-issued template to falsely state they received their shots."
