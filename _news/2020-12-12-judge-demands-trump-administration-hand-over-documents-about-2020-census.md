title: "Judge demands Trump administration hand over documents about 2020 Census"
excerpt: "A federal judge has given the Trump administration until Monday to produce documents related to the timing and processing of the 2020 Census. U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh of the Northern District of California said in her ruling late Thursday night that what the Justice Department has so far produced in a lawsuit about the timing of the survey has been “inadequate” and rife with duplications."
