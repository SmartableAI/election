title: "AP FACT CHECK: Trump stokes Jan. 6 conspiracy theories"
excerpt: "In comments over the past week, Trump insinuated that a Democratic partisan shot Babbitt — it was actually a Capitol Police officer defending the House chamber from attackers such as her. And Trump said Babbitt was shot in the head — in reality she was shot in the shoulder and died from the wound."
