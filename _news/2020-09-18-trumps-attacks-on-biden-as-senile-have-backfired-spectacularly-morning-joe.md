excerpt: "Addressing Donald Trump’s early attacks on former Vice President Joe Biden as being “senile,” MSNBC host Joe Scarborough and “Morning Joe” regular John Heilemann stated the president’s campaign has backed off that talking point because it ‘backfired” on the president — particularly with the senior voters he desperately needs."
