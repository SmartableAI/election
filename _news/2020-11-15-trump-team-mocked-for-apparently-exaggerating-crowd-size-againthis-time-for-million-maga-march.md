title: "Trump Team Mocked For Apparently Exaggerating Crowd Size (Again)—This Time For ‘Million Maga March’"
excerpt: "The White House seems to have again been caught in a fib when it comes to overstating crowd size, after Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany claimed Saturday that “More than one MILLION” marchers descended on Washington for the “Million MAGA March” in support of President Donald Trump—a claim that many on social media pointed out seemed to be greatly overstated based on actual pictures of the event."
