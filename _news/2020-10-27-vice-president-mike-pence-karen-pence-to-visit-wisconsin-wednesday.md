  - title: "Trump faces Wednesday deadline for Wisconsin vote recount"
    excerpt: "President Donald Trump faces a Wednesday deadline to file for a recount in Wisconsin after Democrat Joe Biden defeated him in the state by more than 20,600 votes based on final canvassed totals. The totals submitted by all 72 counties to the state elections commission showed Trump with a roughly six-tenths of a point margin â€” close enough for Trump to file for a recount."
