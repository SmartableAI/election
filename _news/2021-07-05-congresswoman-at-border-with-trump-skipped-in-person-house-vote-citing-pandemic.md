title: "Congresswoman at Border With Trump Skipped In-Person House Vote Citing Pandemic"
excerpt: "Representative Lisa McClain (R-MI) cited the pandemic as a reason she voted by proxy, a system she previously railed against while visiting the southern border with Donald Trump. Rep. McClain voted by proxy last Tuesday and Wednesday in a letter seen by Newsweek where she said she was \"unable to physically attend proceedings in the House Chamber due to the ongoing public health emergency."
