title: "The Daily 202: Trump eggs on boos that previous leaders shushed"
excerpt: "I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him but offering our next president our goodwill and earnest effort to find ways to come together.” Obama grew annoyed just before the election in 2016 when a crowd he was speaking to in North Carolina would not stop booing a Trump supporter who was heckling him."
