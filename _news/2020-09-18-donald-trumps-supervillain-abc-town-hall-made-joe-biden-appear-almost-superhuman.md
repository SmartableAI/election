title: "Donald Trump's supervillain ABC town hall made Joe Biden appear almost superhuman"
excerpt: "Five minutes later, Joe Biden’s town hall began. The contrast was startling. Unlike Trump — who sat during his town hall — Biden stood during his, as if the national anthem were playing. Trump looked lumpish and sounded confused."
