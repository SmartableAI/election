title: "Stock market live updates: Stocks rise, Trump knocks stimulus, personal income falls"
excerpt: "This is a markets live blog for CNBC PRO subscribers that will be updated throughout the day. The major indexes rose on Wednesday morning as the S&P 500 looked to snap a three-day losing streak. The move came despite President Donald Trump calling the new stimulus deal reached by Congress a \"disgrace\" and called for the amount of direct checks to Americans to be increased."
