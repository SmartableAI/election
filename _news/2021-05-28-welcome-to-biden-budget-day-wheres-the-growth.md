title: "Welcome to Biden budget day: Where's the growth?"
excerpt: "President Biden will roll out his first budget proposal today, reportedly a $6 trillion beast that will see spending and deficits soar to records not seen since World II. Eventually, deficits start to come under control under Bidenâ€™s proposal but the debt still well exceeds the size of the economy before that."
