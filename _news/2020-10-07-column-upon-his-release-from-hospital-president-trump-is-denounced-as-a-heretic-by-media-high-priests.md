title: "Column: Upon his release from hospital, President Trump is denounced as a heretic by media high priests"
excerpt: "Estimates released in September show a death rate that is low across the board, especially among the young and healthy, but the drumbeat in politics and media has been all about fear. The high priests of the Washington establishment media who have thrown their lot in with the Democratic Party and Joe Biden for the 2020 campaign were outraged by Trump."
