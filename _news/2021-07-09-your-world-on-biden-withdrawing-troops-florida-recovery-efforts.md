title: "'Your World' on Biden withdrawing troops, Florida recovery efforts"
excerpt: "That seems to be a pretty poor messaging optic to get out of there, but, overall, to leave and withdraw the troops, it's the old cliche of just ripping off the Band-Aid. It has to be done. There's a lot of forces behind this that are slow-rolling it and that benefit monetarily and economically and geopolitically from us being there."
